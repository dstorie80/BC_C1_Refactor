# BC_C1_Refactor

## Description

This project was created to get a better understanding of how the css functions on a functional webpage and how it can be streamlined and appear more sleek while keeping the existing 
functionality.

- The modivation for this was to understand the different groupings of IDs and Classes that relate to the webpage and are pulled from the CSS
- This project was built to test the understanding and usage of GIT and how a CSS relates to the index page 
- By going over the css and Index.html we were able to see what makes a website funcion and what problems could have been missed initially by a developer 
- We were also able to see how to launch a website using GIT and being able to see the full functionality as well as being able to test any changes made to the index or css docs
- From this project, I was able to see the steps in action of starting a repo on git and branching out then merging the different branches using git commands in git bash.  
  I was then able see changes mad to the index as well as the CSS and how they would affect a live website as well as the main/branches of the git repo
